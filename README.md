# Description
This is a copy of the game wordle that I made for fun. There is nothing superior or different about this version so it was just a fun coding project for me with no other purpose.


Also I have one list of words and one list of common words. The common words are used for the random word you are guessting and the other list is used for checking if your guess is a real word.

Currently there is a bug. As an example if the word is "house" and you guess "freed", both of the "e"'s will be yellow. This is wrong because that implies there are 2 e's when there is only one. I have not fixed this cause I am lazy.
